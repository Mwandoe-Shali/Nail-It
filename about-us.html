    <em><strong><h2>The Story Behind.</h2></strong></em>
    <p>Inspiration comes in many different forms. Mine came about as I was in a walk trying to find what can I do that will be compatible with my daily work. </p>
    <p>I am a Quantity Surveyor ( A fancy name for a person who calculates what is needed for a building to be built to completion ). On construction sites the major hurdle is stock taking of what remains and what lags behind, because a slight delay may cause the trickle effect into the whole plan, thus having a good number of materials on site ensures the continuity of events. </p>
    <p>Thus, the idea of a construction stock taking was born.</p>
